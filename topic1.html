<h1 id="www">World Wide Web</h1>
<h2 id="head1">What is the World Wide Web?</h2>
<p id="para1">The World Wide Web is a network of interconnected public web sites that may be accessed over the internet. It comprises a large number of papers that are accessible to the user and are all connected by hyperlinks. Hyperlinks highlight a word or phrase that takes you to another document that contains further information on the word or phrase you first clicked on. Web servers, which are computer programmes that save and transfer documents to certain other computers as they are requested, are used by the WWW. Clients are programmes that connect to the server and request documents. Web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Firefox, are software applications that allow users to view and retrieve content stored on the internet.</p>

<h2 id="head2">What is the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet?</h2>
<p>The pages you see when you're online on a device are known as the world wide web, or web for short. However, the internet is the network of connected computers on which the web operates, as well as the network through which emails and files go. Consider the internet to be the highways that connect towns and cities, and the World Wide Web to be the building that's built on top of those highways. The internet is made up of a lot of smaller networks, or "private networks." If you aren't familiar with private networks, think of it like a map where there are roads but not many houses. The private networks don't have many connections with each other because they are mostly between cities and towns.</p>

<h2 id="header">What is an intranet and its differences from the internet</h2>
<p id="para3">An intranet is a private network within an organisation that allows employees to securely exchange company information and computing resources. Being created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, the system serves as the world's main service that allows people to retrieve information from the internet by using the coding language of web pages, HyperText Transfer Protocol (also know has HTTP). The internet, being developed in the early 1900s and was first publicly announced in the mid 1950s is a global system of networks, which connects devices and computers globally. The internet is utilised for almost any information-related function and can be accessed by anybody with a network connection. It provides numerous methods for sharing information, including the World Wide Web, email, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and instant messaging services. Overall, the WWW and the internet are two distinct technologies that greatly aid internet users in their quest for knowledge. The WWW is only one component of the internet that uses it.</p>

<h2>What is an internet protocol</h2>
<p>The Internet Technology (IP) is a network layer communications protocol that allows data to be routed and addressed across networks. IP information is linked to packets, which are smaller chunks of data, and this information assists in getting the data within the packets to its destination address on the internet. Every site on the internet has an IP address, which is a unique identification issued to the device and to which packets are directed. in order for data to be transferred to its final destination.</p>
<p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a network transport layer protocol that enables applications and devices to interact with one another over a network. It establishes a connection between the source and destination prior to transmission and ensures that it remains active until communication begins, and then breaks down huge volumes of data into smaller packets, enabling reliable data transmission. TCP is frequently used in conjunction with another protocol, IP, to send data between destinations, resulting in a TCP/IP connection. Once the IP address has been obtained and recognised, IP supplies the address of the destination to which the data is to be transmitted, and TCP is responsible for transmitting the data to that destination.</p>
<p id="para4">The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the standard application layer protocol, provides the backbone for the whole web. It enables HTTP clients (web browsers) to submit file requests to web servers in order to exchange files in order to open and load web pages. When the server accepts the request, the user is provided access to the information, which is shown on the user's screen for them to view. Because a TCP/IP connection is required before a file request can be made, HTTP is based on the TCP standard. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an application layer communications protocol used to share data between a client and the server. It then transfers files across machines over a TCP/IP connection. Both computers, known as the 'local host' and the 'remote host,' must always be connected to the network andÂ have FTP software installed, and be able to transmit files through FTP. The server must also be able to perform FTP services.</p>
